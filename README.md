# Movie Landing Page Demo

A web application for searching and displaying movie information, built with Django (backend) and React (frontend). Also I was learning on how to migrate my SQLite database to PostgreSQl so I have all the movies imported from another website and into my PostgreSQL DB so it can search locally, however the pictures weren't included in them, so I had to use the API Key to get some pictures and ended up not using the search from local DB. Not every movie in their DB has pictures and I didn't want to go manually adding as many pics possible to every movie otherwise that would cause a memory crash in my system and the app would run slower in localhost.
